# Ferris Bueller's Word Guess Game

Think you know the ins and outs of one of the greatest teen comedies of the '80's? Think again! In this Word Guess Game, you'll be challenged to guess the name of a character from the beloved John Hughes film. Just guess letters one at a time by typing them, and if the letter is in the secret word or phrase, it will appear on the screen. Complete the puzzle, and you'll be rewarded with a photo from the movie and a song from the soundtrack!

Play again and again, and watch your score grow! (Save Ferris!)
